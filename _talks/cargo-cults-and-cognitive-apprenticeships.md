Mel: Hello!

I’m going to talk about cargo cults and cognitive apprenticeships, two different approaches that faculty can take to adopting unfamiliar curricular cultures -- ways of approaching teaching and learning.

My name is Mel Chua, and I’m presenting on behalf of myself and my postdoc supervisor Lynn Stein.

For the past two years, we’ve been looking at the faculty who visit Olin College. Olin is a small engineering school that does a lot of pedagogical experimentation, so faculty from other schools will come to learn about curricular change.

And we’ve found it useful to be able to talk about their approach as being either a cargo cult one, or a cognitive apprenticeship one. And yes, in practice it’s a mix of attributes of both, and people go back and forth, but they are two distinctly different ways to think about learning a new curricular culture.
