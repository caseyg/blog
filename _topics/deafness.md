title: Deafness
category: hearing
description: Perspectives on life as a bimodal and multicultural auditory low-pass filter who is also an overly analytical intersectional geek. Deaf perspectives are (unavoidably) in all of my writing, but these are more explicitly about that aspect of my being - for instance, I have trouble choosing between d/Deaf, so I throw it at the start of sentences to avoid the problem.
