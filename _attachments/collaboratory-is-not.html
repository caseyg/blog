excerpt: Three simple marker sketches. The page is labeled "The Collaboratory is not..."
  The first sketch is a large version of the Olin logo, with part of of it sectioned
  out and labeled "Collab(oratory)". It is labeled "a center at Olin," and crossed
  out with a big red X. The second sketch is a copy machine labeled "Collab(oratory),"
  with an Olin logo going in and many Olin logos coming out. It is labeled "an Olin
  cloning machine," and crossed out with a big red X. The third sketch is a factory
  labeled with the Olin logo, with a truck labeled "Collab(oratory)" driving towards
  a picture of the planet. It is labeled "an Olin export system" and is crossed out
  with a big red X.
