<p>Before my mother was a mother, <a href="http://cialis-usa.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">ask</a>  she was a dentist. I'm not sure how many other kindergarteners got bedtime stories about gingivitis, <a href="http://viagragenericonline.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">try</a>  but I always thought they were hilarious (if somewhat embarrassing).</p>
<p>So when I was 11 or so, I wrote her this parody, set to the tune of "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" from Mary Poppins. I've written many parodies since, including "Stuck in the Dealership" (to "Day-Oh") when my parents were buying a new car, but none have ever quite become as popular as this one.</p>
<p>I've made two minor edits from the original here. "While demonstrating this with plastic teeth she had out on display" was originally "And ended with a sermon saying why I couldn't play," (which worked a lot better when I was 11...) and the last line's "modify" was originally "work upon." Otherwise, what you're seeing is the original from 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Love you, Mom. (Miss you too.)</p>
<p>(In case you don't know the tune, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An-0Lj0HiNQ">listen to this</a> - song starts a minute or so into the video.)</p>
<p><strong>The dentist song</strong></p>
<p>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious<br />
You should brush your teeth or you will get some halitosis<br />
Or else rinse with Listerine in super-heavy doses<br />
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</p>
<p><em>Um-diddle-diddle, um-diddle-ay<br />
Um-diddle-diddle, um-diddle-ay</em></p>
<p>One day I didn't brush my teeth and went down in a rush<br />
My mother yelled because I smelled and said "go back and brush,"<br />
I asked her what the big deal was and after a short pause<br />
She said "well, you should brush your teeth more often just because..."</p>
<p>(Oh!)</p>
<p>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious<br />
You should brush your teeth or you will get some halitosis<br />
Or else rinse with Listerine in super-heavy doses<br />
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</p>
<p><em>Um-diddle-diddle, um-diddle-ay<br />
Um-diddle-diddle, um-diddle-ay</em></p>
<p>Another time I didn't brush my mother came to say,<br />
"Your teeth will rot, your breath will stink, unless you brush today,"<br />
And she went on to talk about how plaque can cause decay<br />
While demonstrating this with plastic teeth she had out on display</p>
<p>(Why!)</p>
<p>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious<br />
You should brush your teeth or you will get some halitosis<br />
Or else rinse with Listerine in super-heavy doses<br />
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</p>
<p><em>Um-diddle-diddle, um-diddle-ay<br />
Um-diddle-diddle, um-diddle-ay</em></p>
<p>So finally I brushed my teeth and joined my smiling mother<br />
She told the ranks of pearly teeth, "we finally have another!"<br />
Your questions and your stinky breath were such an awful bother -<br />
Come on, let's try to modify the hygiene of your brother!</p>
<p>(Since!)</p>
<p>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious<br />
You should brush your teeth or you will get some halitosis<br />
Or else rinse with Listerine in super-heavy doses<br />
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious<br />
(Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!)<br />
Note that nothing is in the queue. NOTHING. Everything is actively being worked on and resolved. This is a wonderful, <a href="http://viagracoupongeneric.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">for sale</a>  wonderful feeling.</p>
