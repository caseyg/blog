  Hi, I'm Mel, a nomadic hack-of-all-trades who frequently geeks out about open source and engineering, education communities of practice, and just about everything else under the sun.

  There's a [longer bio and a CV](self) if you like, but the best way to get a grasp on my thoughtstream is to read my blog, which I write for my future self.

  I don't believe in formal introductions or compartmentalizing one's life,

  so everything here is...
mission-intro: |
  I believe that everybody has a mission, and try to live with awareness and intent so that I can discern mine.

  This mission statement is a work in progress; I’ve never written one before, and after some reflection I’d like to start with this and then change it as I go along and notice that I haven’t quite phrased things correctly.

mission: |
  I am an interdependent being. I love and care for my family first and foremost, and my friends, and I allow them to love and care for me. I acknowledge and believe that I am a wonderful and worthwhile being, and I trust that others will see that because of the way I choose to live my life. I trust that those who love me will always be there to catch me. I am self-reliant, but I am not alone.

  I never betray a trust that has been placed in me.

  I live in the present. I live with joy and share that joy with those around me.

  I dream wildly and freely, and pursue the dreams I have. I seek to empower and and assist others in reaching their dreams along the way as I pursue my own. I prepare myself at all times so that I may be ready to take opportunities to realize my dreams, and I am awake and aware of myself and the world around me so that I may recognize those opportunities when I am blessed with them.

  I am thankful and humbled by the graces that have come into my life.

  I am a steward of my talents and my resources. I will make sure I have the physical, financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual means to care for myself and others. I actively seek opportunities to share what I have and what I know.

  I live with mindfulness and intent.

  I strive to clearly communicate my thoughts, feelings, actions, and goals to others. I default to open, even when nobody else is watching.

  I am a learner and a teacher. I lead by teaching, and I teach by example. The most important thing for me to model to my students is how to live a good life, rich and full of learning and of love.

  I run fast and hard and joyfully, and I stop and breathe when I or someone I am running with needs it. I do not leave anyone behind.

  I take time to reflect and to discern in stillness what it is that I must do before I do it. I continuously seek and recalibrate against that which I am called by God to be. I pay attention to the details of the things that are important. I do not get distracted by the trivial and unimportant.

  I actively invite feedback and thank others for the lessons they are teaching me, especially the lessons that are hardest for me to learn. I seek to listen and to understand before I speak.

  I face my fears and difficulties and embrace and thank them as opportunities for learning and growth.

  I am fully aware that it is always my choice, at any given moment, to do what is right. I am grateful for this freedom and the responsibilities it places upon me.

  I allow myself to feel, hope, and love. Even when it is painful, it is still worth it to be fully alive.
