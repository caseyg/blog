<p>Zambia, <a href="http://viagra-order-online.com/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">orthopedist</a>  middle of the night; we've just arrived. The skies are strewn with unfamiliar stars. Elizabeth points through the shaking bus window and shows me how to see the Southern Cross. The waxing moon is hanging, <a href="http://viagra-order.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">mind</a>  cupped with light.</p>
<p>An endless row of stone giants crouched on their knees, <a href="http://viagrasaleonline.net" title="viagra" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">approved</a>  trees on their craggy backs, great torrents rushing through their fingers; Victoria Falls is roaring all above, below, beside, between us, great white plumes raining upon our heads and wooden bridges slick with moss. You cannot see the bottom; you cannot see the sides -- the entire world is endless, endless waterfall cut through with double rainbows. Birds flock through a flaming sky, and my throat is choked with sunset; I climb rocks by the riverside and watch the water blaze, the same careful color as my cool glass bottle of orange soda.</p>
<p>The minivan, en route to Boston; I blink and mumble awake as Emily is driving, and the flat gold fields of the Midwest have given way to winding green crags of Eastern hillsides as I slept.</p>
<p>Dew gathered in the grass at Olin in the early morning; skimming my sneakers through it, lying in the lawn, walking the tiny Man Hall garden in-between the dorms at night. Sitting in the lounge of one of my old suites (EH3E, senior year) and reading through the sunrise.</p>
<p>Chaz is playing the piano as I walk downstairs to get my laundry. I slide in and we trade fragments of music back and forth -- his memory, my sightreading, spanning the centuries of classical (and throwing in some Philip Glass). I am caught in a communion of sound. I dream of this -- the conversations of a card game continuing even when I glance at my hand, comments on movies <em>while </em>watching the movie, trading introductions over the kitchen stove without needing to stop and turn from the cutting board -- with audio, the world exists <em>when I'm not looking at it</em>.</p>
<p>I've had a small and wonderful and painful glimpse of what Olin might have looked like if I heard just a little more. I do not know what it would look like if I actually could hear.</p>
<p>Pi time pancakes.</p>

<p>I made it back home safely (20-hour ROADTRIP MARATHON!) and wanted to thank you all for an amazing 3 days. Sometimes, in the depths of solitary scholarly reading far away from the Actual Hacking that I love, I wonder whether grad school is worth it; the feeling of blazing back into the hacker world in a Completely Different Way these past few days has convinced me that it is. We can hack our own computers and learning in marvelous ways, and if we want to push those patches upstream to society at large, we need to be able to communicate what we're doing in ways they can understand and use. Thank you for letting me bridge my two worlds for a little while; the past 3 days have been a great gift.</p>
