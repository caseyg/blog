<p>Allies are awesome. This weekend has been full of tiny world-crossings, of watching people open themselves to new experiences.</p>
<p>I saw a hearing couple suddenly become fervent captioning advocates when they realized how garbled a poorly-captioned video would be with the sound off. This led to a spirited -- and blunt -- discussion between them, me, and a hard-of-hearing friend on how to make our parish workshops more accessible. That doesn't just mean captions -- it means thinking about singing st<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today was full of tiny strange experiences, crossing worlds</p>
<p>However, we've still got some work to do. Nearly every line of captioning had errors -- I've attached some photos we took of the TV demonstrating the issue. We had captions like "LIKE HOMEOWN LOCATIONS OR SCHOOL NAS" and "THE NEXT TIME I COULD GETHEM AS TWHTO SIT IN MY LAP.OVER." The two deaf/hard-of-hearing participants were able to make sense of it because we're used to translating lossy English into understandable prose -- I'm a PhD student and Betsy is a librarian -- but it took some work, and many Deaf people (who read English as a second language) would have really struggled to do that. The two hearing facilitators (Kathy and Frank) said that if they were watching the video with the captions on and the audio off, they would have a hard time understanding it themselves!</p>
<p>What can we do to improve the captioning on future versions of the video -- or is there a version with more accurate captioning/subtitling available? We noticed the video example on the Virtus website is both open-captioned (captions are shown on the screen by default) and that the open captions there are absolutely perfect, and didn't want to assume you hadn't yet addressed this somehow.</p>
<p>I'm copying Betsy McCarthy, a member of our Deaf Catholic Council who was at the training today, and Kathy and Frank Montesanti, who are the trainers for the course. All of them have expressed interest in helping out with this and working with you to make Catholic media and training more accessible. You've got good stuff here, and we'd like to pitch in as fellow members of the Body of Christ to make it even better. Captions improve understanding not only for deaf/hard-of-hearing folks, but for non-native English speakers and many seniors -- a significant portion of American parish volunteership.</p>
<p>Please let us know what we can do to move this forward, and thanks again for all your help.</p>
