<p>Things I have read that swirl around my mind.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://millionlegoforkids.com/about/">privilege of toys</a> and who gets to play what and when with who.</p>
<p><a href="http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/issue/view/1234/showToc">Decolonization </a>in teaching and learning -- the notion that we, teachers successful within the dominant paradigm, will come "emancipate" the "lesser" masses is... awfully presumptuous. I've got my own colonialist mentalities and unexamined privilege; even if I'm a deaf minority woman, I've chosen to train so I can hold my own in a white man's world as measured by able-bodied, Anglocentric metrics, and I need to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decolonizing-Methodologies-Research-Indigenous-Peoples/dp/1848139500">be aware at all times</a> that this isn't <em>the</em> pinnacle of achievement that everyone should be "freed" to climb. Mandates of English as a <em>lingua franca </em>aren't just unfair, they <a href="www.languageonthemove.com/language-globalization/multilingual-provision-is-cheaper-than-english-only">don't make economic sense)</a> Multivocality is similar. Talk in your tongue, stand on your turf; assimilation, not subordination, is the fullest kind of conquest that there is -- be who you are, where you are, and bridge from that.</p>
<p>Seeing my own Impostor Syndrome and <em>still </em>having it. I've always thought and written <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/38358656/So-how-does-it-work-%E2%80%93-Rhizomatic-Methodologies">rhizomatically about my research</a>, and it was a blessing I didn't know that wasn't "normal" -- because when I found out, I went through a doubt drought where I had to <em>constantly </em>remind myself to trust my gut. I don't <em>need </em>external justification, but it still helps, even if I don't want it to -- reading other post-ists lets me know I can <em>cite </em>them and be validated by an academic world I've chosen to care about. Explaining and justifying yourself constantly can be exhausting.</p>
<p>Plenty of good material on open access and transparency. Ana showed me the <a href="http://openscienceframework.org/">Open Science Framework</a>, which is linked to the <a href="http://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</a> and a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/is-psychology-about-to-come-undone/29045">project to reproduce experiments</a> to check validity of journals. It's hard to sort through the tangle of "openwashing" in academia and government; some people <a href="http://opensource.com/government/13/4/open-government-beyond-open-data">throw around buzzwords</a> like "transparency" and "participation" without understanding what they are and how they're linked. Much of my work -- research, writing, teaching, activism -- is about transparency, but I also <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/usefultransparency">agree with Aaron</a> that transparency is a means and not an end, not a magic wand. And <a href="http://hblog.org/2013/03/03/february-2013-the-openness-edition/">what do ethnographic researches make of this</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/er9/deliberate_practice_for_decision_making/">Deliberate practice</a> on creating space. This<a href="calnewport.com/blog/2013/04/03/you-can-be-busy-or-remarkable-but-not-both/"> discipline of doing less</a>, of making room and time to breathe.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://smallstarsblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/its-only-been-a-year-or-so/">read things</a> that could very well be <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/2013/02/08/on-being-married-to-an-academic-toward-an-understanding-of-being-the-second-in-a-two-body-problem-a-guest-post/">echoes of my future</a> as seen and written by me about someone I care about, or about me by someone who knows me well -- pride and work,Â <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/opinion/lean-in-what-about-child-care.html?_r=0">articulated unfairness</a>, exhaustion and frustration tumbled in with love -- what does it mean, the sort of womanhood I'm making and remaking by my life?</p>
