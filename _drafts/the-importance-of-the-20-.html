<p>Michael DeHaan's post on <a href="http://michaeldehaan.net/2009/08/11/seeing-behind-the-curtain-quantifying-oss-contribution-size/">lookatgit</a> uncovers a way of thinking about open source contribution that might be especially helpful to professors and students (and other people who are thinking "I want to help, but I'm not sure how to begin."</p>
<blockquote><p>My theory on this — OSS is most interesting not because of size of “outside” contributions. The best patches are done by clever ninjas. Frequency of commits don’t always count … what counts are /diversity/ of commits and all the other incidental things that you can’t compress into metrics...</p>
<p>What’s the difference between a project that is 80% complete and one that is 100% complete? What is the difference between a raw amethyst or ruby and a cut and polished gemstone? (Not saying I possess any gemstones). It’s that 20%. That 20% can be HUGE and often it is coming in the form of new ideas and outside perspective. 20% is the difference between “I’d rather use X” and “this really works for me”. It’s the difference between a C and an A grade. Further, the last 20% is the hardest area of polishing — it’s the stuff it takes many different people to notice, it’s not something you can do as roughly or quickly. Thus, looking at things in terms of commit counts or LOC counts is not sufficient. Another analogy — someone building a car. Maybe 80% of the car by mass is the engine or the frame, but you can’t stop there.</p>
<p>So, when gauging your contributions, it’s not about metrics, it’s about stories. It’s “remember when ____ rewrote my web interface for me”, or “remember when ____ and ____ worked together to write that awesome LDAP plugin” or “remember when _____ contributed the email script”. Those are things we want to foster.</p></blockquote>
<p>These stories sound great from the student side as well. Being able to ask a professor for a recommendation leter by opening with "remember when I rewrote ___'s web interface?" or tell an interviewer "I worked together with ___ to write that awesome LDAP plugin" or "I contributed the email script for ____."</p>
<p>One thing I hear over and over again from students goes something like this: "Maybe we should go off on our own and start an open source project from scratch, because we can't possibly make core contributions to such a well-established project in such a short period of time." No! No! You don't <em>have</em> to make huge contributions to the codebase! The core you contribute to is the community, <em>not</em> the code. (Case in point: I just did some back-of-the-envelope figuring, and I seem to average less than 100 lines of code <em>per year</em>. )</p>
<p>Your most valuable contribution to open source is <em>being</em> a newcomer to a well-established project for a short period of time. Start from who you are, not who you think you ought to be. You can do something we can't - we who work on this stuff every day, have worked on it for years, who do it as our job - you're free (both mentally and time-wise) to do the polishing and= see where the polishing can be done. You can take us from the 80% of "eh, it's okay" to the 100% of "this is <em>freakin' awesome.</em>" Be publicly confused about things that don't make sense (blogs + Planet aggregators = good for this). One fun mindset-flip is to try to make something happen while writing as <em>few </em>lines of code as possible.</p>
<p>You can also think of it this way: "Not everyone is using and/or contributing to open source" is a bug. If you can't figure out a way to help, that is a bug <em>for us</em> that <em>only you</em> can help us fix.</p>
