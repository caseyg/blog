<p><strong>What I am doing for myself:</strong></p>
<p>Reminding myself that I am human, <a href="http://tadalafilforsale.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">website like this</a>  capable of doing glorious things, <a href="http://viagrafreepills.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">case</a>  and fallible.</p>
<p><strong>What I need from the group</strong> (this will make more sense if you read the “what I want to do for the world at large” section first):</p>
<ul>
<li>gentle reminders to follow through and focus</li>
<li>reminders that I am a sprinter by nature, <a href="http://cialis-buy-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">what is ed</a>  and should let myself sprint once in a while</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I want to give to the group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Myself. Basically, I see myself in the role of teacher (well, more like Finder-Of-Knowledge), with the Yellow House as my school/laboratory.</li>
<li>A drive for teaching, which is, at its heart, sharing what you have with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I want to do for the world at large:</strong></p>
<p>In the touchy-feely realm: I am a sprinter by nature, both physically and mentally. This means that I can generate large amounts of enthusiasm and insane spurts of work for short periods of time, but have a hard time sustaining the slow, steady plod that’s often needed to really see things through. (In Belbin Inventory terms, I’m a Plant &amp; Resource Investigator – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belbin_Team_Inventory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belbin_Team_Inventory</a> – in Myers-Briggs terms I’m an <span class="caps">INFP</span>, an Idealist.) I am teaching myself how to complement my sprints with the ability to run mental marathons.</p>
<p><strong>In the more technical realm:</strong></p>
<p>There are three disciplines I intend to focus on and gain mastery in throughout my life, so I will have powerful tools to wield For Justice and all that good stuff. (You’ll notice the three disciplines can cover almost everything – that’s because I’m still Mel.)</p>
<ul>
<li>“Hacking” – Open-Content and Open-Source development and evangelism: the creation and propagation of technologies that aim to make information universally accessible to all those who wish it. This is the reason I am training as an <span class="caps">ECE</span> with a strong focus on software, although other talents (writing, design, participation in the online world) also factor in.</li>
<li>“Teaching” – Engineering education: mentoring others in using technology as a tool for making the world as you dream it ought to be. This is the reason I will go to grad school someday, the reason <span class="caps">I TA</span>, why my <span class="caps">AHS</span> capstone is the <span class="caps">ECS</span> textbook, and why I want to return to Olin and/or be a higher education administrator someday. I also recognize that I can only be a great teacher in the intellectual realm of engineering if I am mature myself in the intellectual, spiritual, and physical realms, which is why I will keep myself educated (I will be a student of something at all times), healthy (this will take a while), and at peace with myself, the world, and God (who I’ve been neglecting woefully for years).</li>
<li>“Anthrodesigning” – being the eyes and ears of product development and entrepreneurship strategy: listening to the people of the world, especially the currently ignored or underpriveleged, and conveying the realities of their needs to those in a position to fill them (especially entrepreneurs) This is why I am taking a year off to travel, watch, and learn after college, why I am becoming multilingual, why I am interested in anthropology and human factors, and why I am learning about business. It is how I will harness my inhuman reading speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the absolutely concrete physical realm:</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow House, which has been a dream under development for almost a decade now. This will be the closest thing I’ll ever have to a home; it’ll be a big house that’s really more like a residential inventor’s workshop, with office space for the current startup operating from it, tinkering space and a glorious machine shop filling the basement and garage, a room set aside for music, a steady stream of intellectual guests, and several other likeminded longish-term residents. And it will be yellow, darn it, because the 10-year-old Mel said so.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How do you want to be helped to do things yourself?</strong></p>
<p>For myself, I am going to remember to sleep, eat, and take care of myself. Taking time every day to step back and reassess where I’m going. Remaining a perpetual student (literally; I will always be enrolled in at least one class or one course of self-study).</p>
<p><strong>2. How do you want others to help you, and how do you want to help others?</strong></p>
<p><strong>To give to others in the group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Myself. My knowledge and resources are always yours to share; I am a teacher by nature and never consider spreading information to those who want it to be a waste of my time.</li>
<li>More specifically, I will probably grow up to be one of those people who knows a little about everything, and who to talk to about anything. Think of me as a human Wikipedia, a walking library catalogue, a Google on legs, and take advantage of my Jack Of All Tradesness.</li>
<li>I am good at improv-like things; quick sketches, quick hacks (electrical and mechanical), spur of the moment presentations/lessons, facilitating brainstorms, and improv comedy itself. Take advantage of this.</li>
<li>Eventually, the Yellow House. More on this later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I will probably not be able to give to the group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Money, glory, power, and fame. It is unlikely that I will ever become rich. It is unlikely that I will ever become famous or powerful in any sort of official capacity; I will never be the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of a large company, nor will I ever be a billionaire, or a news magnate, or a movie star.</li>
<li>A stable location with a constant Mel presence. Although I intend to have the Yellow House or some similar thing, I will be traveling often, and will likely never put down strong physical or emotional roots with any one group, person, or geographic location.</li>
<li>Someone who is socially adept in “polite society.” I feel awkward in anything fancier than a collared shirt, don’t go for titles or formalities, and cringe at gratitious rituals of social politeness. Doesn’t mean I can’t tolerate it gracefully (...well, I’ll learn how eventually) on occasion, but it’s not my realm and never will be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mentors, lessons, connections, and general resource pointers, project buddies, and pointers to project buddies in any of the three disciplines I’m going for.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More specifically, right now:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a workout buddy</li>
<li>an entrepreneurship buddy – I want to start a business, darn it.</li>
<li>an open source buddy – I’m hacking and would love company</li>
<li>a spiritual/philosophical buddy – or incessant reminders that I need to both meditate and look for a church.</li>
<li>space and equipment for a mini workshop and library of hackerdom, the seed of the Yellow House. I’ve long dreamed of setting up a corner of a suite lounge to be dedicated hack space (our own private lab), but never did.</li>
<li>help with travel plans for my year(s) off – current plan is to learn farming in India, tai chi in China, and road trip across America learning about the current public education system, but this is all very flexible still.</li>
<li>help learning about personal finances – I want to be able to set up a system of investments and savings that I can automate and forget about… and then retire on. Thus far I have not found a satisfactory system, nor have I found satisfactory software to manage said system.</li>
<li>help learning about real estate, probably in the Boston area – it’s time to start preparing for physically purchasing the Yellow House, although the actual money to do this will probably not be here for at least another decade. <strong>3. How do you want to go about changing the world?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By learning what I want to learn and seeing what opportunities open up as a result of my gradual mastery of things.</p>
<p><strong>4. Write the opening to a fiction story starring the group.</strong></p>
<p>It was a dark and stormy night… (Sorry – I can’t come up with a good answer to this one.)</p>
<p><strong>Future</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What would you like to have accomplished in ten years? In twenty-five years?</strong></p>
<p>I’m making this all up as I go along, but in both cases I would like to be</p>
<ul>
<li>alive</li>
<li>healthy</li>
<li>happy</li>
<li>content<br />
and be able to honestly say that it hasn’t been dull.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may turn out that I have a soulmate out there somewhere, in which case I would hope that I will marry him and perhaps have a family. In this case, I would like to have a balance between my work and my family that satisfies both me and them (I will not drop my career for 20 years to wash dishes while the kids grow up, but I do want to teach and raise my own offspring if I ever have any).</p>
<p>Of course, it may well be that I’m meant to be a free-spirited single forever; that’s fine too. I’d say the two are equal in probability at this point, and I don’t care either way. Whatever happens.</p>
<p>When I die, I want people to be able to say I used the talents that I was given in the best way I could have used them – by passing them on to my students (and not necessarily in a formal classroom sense, either). If somebody I have taught goes on to be a better teacher than I was, I’ll count that a success.</p>
<p><strong>2. What permanent facilities would you like to have for yourself in ten years? In twenty-five years?</strong></p>
<p>See Yellow House.</p>
<p><strong>3. What permanent facilities would you like to have for others in ten years? In twenty-five years?</strong></p>
<p>See Yellow House. See several Yellow House spinoffs made by other people inspired by the original. See variants of Yellow Houses springing up in universities.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else you want to say? Say it here.</strong></p>
<p>Math is fun!</p>

<p>1b. Freelance tinkerer in no particular discipline hopping the internet, the globe, and various little points in the nonprofit/commercial/academic world from project to project as a consultant of sorts – the renaissance Mel for hire. Based in a house (“The Yellow House” – old dream of mine; ask me about it sometime) with a basement workshop and a couple other hackers, but unencumbered enough that I can travel with one duffel for clothes and another for my technology, sleep on a floor or sofa, and feel at home. Writer, blogger, advocate for the open source model (not just for software).<br />
1c. Yellow.</p>
<p>2. I see a world where everyone is free and able to learn what they want to learn. This means open access to information (and the equipment needed to put that knowledge to use) in different formats that will be understandable, accessible, adaptable, and hackable-by many different types of people. It also means enabling people to be able to fit that kind of learning in their lives; no matter how smart you are, it’s hard to go to school if you need to work 15 hours a day to feed your family. I think we’re getting there, and I want to be a part of making this happen, in as many different ways as I can; I know that’s not very well defined yet.</p>
<p>3. I’m afraid that I will spend my energies too close to the ground, spread it too thin helping out too many other people with all their own projects, and never really have it coagulate into something glorious – and similarly, that I will go too far to the other side, too high a level, and forget what it’s like “on the ground.” I am afraid that I won’t be smart enough, fast enough, adept enough to learn and navigate both the technical and social abilities that this will require – especially the social, as I’m not the best at communication. I am afraid that despite any intellectual or publicly social success I might have, I’ll still lack a fulfilling connection with other people (note that there is a difference between being a lone wanderer, which I want to be, and lonely, which I don’t).</p>
<p>4. I see this as a group – remaining relatively small, so that every member knows every other member – where we hold each other accountable for making our dreams real. It won’t be an organization working on one huge project so much as it is a support group (like a writer’s workshop, only with more than stories), although I won’t be surprised if collaborations spring forth from it, and we’ll certainly be hooking each other up with resources and advice. To horribly misquote Thoreau, I want to share blueprints for our castles in the air, so we’ll be better able and encouraged to put the foundations under them.</p>
<p>5. While we’re in school, something like a (lengthy and leisurely) monthly dinner would make sense, perhaps with a longer trip, almost retreat-like, for a full day or even an overnighter somewhere (parcel B?) once or twice during the school year; certainly right before graduation. Once we graduate, it depends on where everyone is, maybe meeting once a year, or more or less, depending on frequency. Basically, these will be times when we take time off and away from the daily rush of Doing Things, step back with each other, and see exactly what it is that we are doing.<br />
