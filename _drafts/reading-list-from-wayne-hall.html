<p>Chronicle of Higher Education (June 2014), top 10 books on teaching (with an emphasis on recent publications):<br />
http://chronicle.com/article/Top-10-Books-on-Teaching/147015/<br />
Another recent work, Engaging Students as Partners in Learning &amp; Teaching:<br />
http://www.amazon.com/Engaging-Students-Partners-Learning-Teaching/dp/1118434587/ref=la_B001JS6ODO_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408647534&amp;sr=1-1<br />
Short version of this book, at http://iced2014.se/proceedings/1146_BovillFeltenCook-Sather%20.pdf<br />
Books that I assigned when I last taught a grad-level course on SoTL:<br />
Pat Hutchings, Mary Taylor Huber, and Anthony Ciccone, The Scholarship of Teaching &amp; Learning Reconsidered: Institutional Integration and Impact (Jossey-Bass, 2011; ISBN: 0470599081)<br />
The most recent book publication on our list, this study draws upon twenty years of research projects on teaching and learning as coordinated by the Carnegie Foundation and its Carnegie Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching &amp; Learning (CASTL).</p>
<p>McKinney, Kathleen. Enhancing Learning Through the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: The Challenges and Joys of Juggling. Anker, 2007; ISBN: 9781933371290)<br />
A review of SoTL generally, including sections on its history and disciplinary status, as well as chapters on how to apply SoTL in the classroom and how to design publishable SoTL projects.<br />
Paul Savory, Amy Nelson Burnett, and Amy Goodburn, Inquiry into the College Classroom (John Wiley; 2007; ISBN: 9781933371252)<br />
With an emphasis on the practical – how to explore teaching questions through conducting classroom research, how to collect and assess data, how to measure the impact of classroom activities – this survey uses an inquiry model that helps faculty become scholarly teachers as well as SoTL researchers.</p>
