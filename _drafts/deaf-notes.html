<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knocking.</p>
<p>Being deaf is always</p>
<p>Hearing test: 5 options simultaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's</p>
<p>I'm often wrong.</p>
<p>This stumped one of the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- which stumped audiologists at the University of Iowa when they were giving me a word recognition test.</p>
<p>(They finally decided that if any of the words I listed was correct, <a href="http://cialis-generic-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">diagnosis</a>  I would be scored as if I'd guessed it right -- despite not knowing <em>which </em>word was correct. I consequently outscored</p>
<p>When I went in for a cochlear implant (CI) evaluation at the University of Iowa, <a href="http://cialis24online.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">gonorrhea</a>  one of the best and most experienced CI centers in the world, I stumped the testing team during my word recognition test.</p>
<p>one of the most experienced cochlear implant surgery centers in the country.</p>
<p>I didn't realize how strange this was until I messed up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all do this, especially if we're not fluent/native speakers of the language we are listening to -- but I do it to an unusual degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that video <em>exactly </em>as well as 99% of the non-captioned videos I watch on YouTube; the first time I came across it, I didn't even</p>
<p>misheard lyricshttp://www.kissthisguy.com/</p>
<p>English is my native language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's constantly feeling like I <em>should </em>be able to understand, and falling short. It's a constant teetering on the edge of <em>maybe if I just try hard enough, </em>and the equally constant guilt of <em>maybe I should have tried harder</em>, because I constantly give up.</p>
<p>This "giving up" is not because</p>
<p>If you run a 100m dash,</p>
<p>And you <em>have to </em>give up, because it is mentally and physically impossible to keep on going -- it's</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- for the same reason a 4-minute-mile pace is unsustainable for an entire marathon. It's the same sort of "giving up"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.davidpeter.me/">David Peter</a> showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4Dfa4fOEY">a video</a> at his <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/speakers/david-peter">AlterConf talk</a> today to demonstrate what a tremendous cognitive and emotional load it can be to hold that uncertainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>--</em> because you <em>do </em>give up. Simultaneous translation is an extraordinary skill; we gasp in awe at someone who can translate Russian into English, and even more</p>
<p>, because human minds can't , constantly falling short. No mind can keep <em><br />
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>constantly giving up out of exhaustion without knowing how close you were to being able to understand. The constant guilt of <em>maybe I should have just tried harder. </em>Never knowing.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>depends on. Every job interview, every university lecture, every time I hang out with people who could become friends -- I fly across that great ocean of silence to reach them, fly across so fast and fluently that they often don't even realize I'm constantly straining to be <em>present</em>, to stand where they are -- because I <em>want </em>to be <em>with </em>them.</p>
