<p><em>I occasionally put class notes on my blog when I want to rethink/revisit/remember things we've done.</em></p>
<p>Today's Fundamentals (dance) class was an introduction to basic principles of the Alexander Technique. I don't remember all of them, but the idea is that gentle <em>thinking </em>about these directions -- rather than muscular forcing -- can help open up and align your body properly.</p>

<li>Head forward (and up)</li>
<li>Shoulders wide</li>
<li>Knees forward</li>
<li>Elbows back</li>
<li>Neck free</li>
</ol>
