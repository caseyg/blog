<li>Pick an initial set of search terms (and expand it as you go through the search process). Keep spelling variants in mind (color vs colour, <a href="http://cheapest-viagra.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">salve</a>  etc). This is the start of your search-terms queue.</li>
<li>Check to see if there's a library guide already written up for your topic (Purdue has many subject-specific library guides) and add them to your resources-to-search queue. You'll be building a giant grid; one axis is search terms, <a href="http://buy-viagraonlineltd.com/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">sick</a>  the other axis is resources-to-search. Your goal for "coverage" is to search for all search terms on all resources-to-search. The remaining things on this list are suggestions for places-to-search.</li>
<li>Look on Google Scholar.</li>
<li>Do a dissertation search on PQDT (mostly US/Canadian) and NDLTD (more international) to see if anyone's already done a super-extensive lit review for their thesis. Maybe I'm strange, but I like reading (good) dissertations; maybe it's because I know I'll have to write one someday.</li>
<li>Check institutional repositories for universities that have researchers that look into your topic. Especially useful if you're interested in non-European, non-North-American countries (Asia, Africa, South America, Oceania, etc) since oftentimes scholars there tend to publish more locally in their IRs instead of in international journals (which they don't have access to).<br />
Search IEEE and ACM for fulltext articles (useful for electrical, computer, and software engineering, and computer science).</li>
<li>Look on Compendex and Inspec (for breadth). Remove duplicates, but keep Inspec; it tends to be more accurate. Use expert search in Compendex. Use codes in Compendex if needed; there's a help page listing the codes but the most useful one is "(&lt;terms&gt;) wn &lt;CODE&gt;" (no quotes). The 'wn' stands for 'within.' (Side note: If you're searching only for papers written in a particular language, you can search by language in Compendex. If you're looking specifically for stuff in German, check out TIBKAT and Springer-Verlag.)</li>
<li>Look on Web of Science.</li>
<li>Look at Citeseerx.</li>
<li>For computer things, look at Safari.</li>
<li>For science things (especially physics), look at Arxive.</li>
<li>Look at Proquest. You can select the database(s) to use. (To get there from Purdue's library homepage, go to the Purdue engineering library homepage, then select "tech research" from the drop-down list of datbases).</li>
<li>Look on government databases, particularly the DTIC (department of defense) and NTIS (government-sponsored research) databases.</li>
