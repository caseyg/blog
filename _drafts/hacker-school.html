<p>Emily Sommer sent some excellent questions from <a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a> that (with her permission) I'm posting my replies to as a case study of how to approach one's first open source project. I had suggested</p>
<div>First up: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/" target="_blank">SVG-edit</a>, which is something I've been looking for since I first learned how to use Adobe Illustrator (6 years ago). [I found this yesterday and was simply ecstatic that it exists as a web app that I can use, then I realized it was built in JavaScript and mildly freaked out in excitement.] It appears to be open to contributors, has an MIT license, and is hosted by Google Code, so I think it's open source. How can I know for sure? It also seems to have a fairly small yet active community. Finally, since it is built mostly in JavaScript I could EASILY contribute (okay, perhaps not immediately easily, but certainly more easily than I could contribute to something like Inkscape, which is built in C++ and will not install on my computer).</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the (brainstormed, off-the-top-of-my-head-last-week) list of things I'm checking.<br />
Can this person independently navigate the resources my project has on the website? (gauging base level initiative and independence)<br />
Is this person trying to do something that would be helpful to me? (legitimate peripheral participation)<br />
Does the email have a concrete, testable goal/outcome in mind?<br />
Are they asking for help on something specific? (if I don't realize they need help, I probably won't give it)<br />
Is there a way I can publicly respond to this person? (so others can learn from it and help with it, and I won't be a bottleneck)</p>
<div></div>
<div>Second: <a href="http://edesignlabs.org/" target="_blank">ED-design labs</a>. They are a community of educators and technologists working together to make experimental, free (I think) educational software for ipads and the web. I found them through <a href="http://codemontage.com/projects" target="_blank">Code Montage</a> (seems like a cool resource). Here is their <a href="https://github.com/EDesignLabs" target="_blank">github account</a> (full of cool projects), but nothing has been updated in two months and more. While looking at their website, I recognized an old friend from college as one of the teachers involved, so I might shoot him an email as a starting point. Again, though, is 2 months too abandoned? And how do I know for sure if they are open source?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those are the three projects that I think would be cool to contribute to. Any feedback you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks Mel! Again, so cool to meet you and work with you a bit last week,</div>
