<p>from http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1304195.htm (Pope Francis)<br />
"It takes courage to start a family, <a href="http://viagraonlinewithoutprescriptionhq.com/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">prothesis</a> " he said, and the modern world not only doesn't help, it seems to put obstacles in the way, "privileging individual rights rather than the family" and trying to convince everyone that relationships should last only as long as there are no difficulties.</p>
<p>Psalm 139: womb imagery kinda hitting home</p>
<p>like a hen gathers her chicks under her wing</p>
<p>the psalm that talks about a weaned child on its mother's lap: child does not need food, it's getting something else. (I want to be a mom like that.)</p>
<p>gaudium et spec</p>
<p>math and religious ed</p>
