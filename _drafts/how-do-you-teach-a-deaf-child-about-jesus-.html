<p>That having been said, <a href="http://viagra-generic-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">adiposity</a>  a library of resources will <em>probably</em> be helpful. Here's what I've found so far:</p>
<p><strong>General Resources</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kept seeing glowing reviews for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553386190">Elaine Costello's book on religious signing</a> ($14.90), so I got it. It has things like name signs for Biblical characters ("Abraham," "Mary," etc.), special religious-related vocabulary ("Eucharist," etc.), <em>and </em>it's interfaith, which makes me super-happy because I love learning about other faith traditions. On the other hand, because it's a book for all religions (ok, as many as Costello could fit in the book), it isn't exactly a stand-alone resource for teaching Catholicism to a Deaf child.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching Catholicism to <em>anyone </em>(Deaf or not, child or not), being able to understand and participate in the Mass is a hugely important thing, so the first thing I looked for was...</p>
<p><strong>Resources for the Mass</strong></p>
<p>I was <em>super </em>excited to find <a href="http://www.romanmissal.org.uk/Home/Resources/Missal-Sign-Language">this DVD</a>, which has <em>all </em>the Mass parts (priest and congregation both!) in sign language, but it turns out that it's in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Sign_Language">BSL</a>. Sorry, wrong country. If only there were an ASL DVD like this!</p>
<p>However, there is not. <a href="https://www.osvparish.com">Our Sunday Visitor</a> has a <a href="https://www.osvparish.com/Shop/Product?ProductCode=X1564">Liturgical Signs and Prayers DVD</a> in ASL ($14.95) which has... some prayers. Maybe some parts of the Mass. I have no idea. I've ordered it and will post notes/reviews here when I get it, but I'm guessing it'll be missing stuff I want, like... oh, most of Mass. (It sounds like the "lite" version of the BSL DVD, which is <em>actually</em> what I want, except... in ASL.) While I wait for that to arrive, the Deaf Apostolate of Boston has a <a href="http://www.deafcatholic.org/Interpreter-Resources/aslliturgicalsignsinacatholicinterpretingsituation/hailmaryprayer">video of Mass responses</a>, but not the entire Mass. However, it <em>is </em>freely available, which I'm grateful for.</p>
<p>Mass <em>readings</em>, on the other hand, I'm <em>probably </em>okay with, sort of. Joan Blake has a book of sign glosses for A, B, and C years -(Catholic Masses read through nearly the entire Bible over the course of a 3-year cycle), and since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568545606">this year is Year A, I got the matching book.</a> ($19.97) I saw the Deaf Apostolate of Boston using this, and their translations were <em>fantastic</em>, so I am assuming it's good. It's got the Psalms and everything -- psalms are so, so pretty in ASL because they're... well, they're songs! So, so excited.</p>
<p>However, these are sign <em>glosses</em>, which assume you already know ASL and just need some translation-helper notes, so I have some catch-up to do since my expressive ASL skills are... lacking, shall we say. Also, the book only has glosses for Sunday Masses, so if you want ASL Daily Mass (which is what goes through the entire Bible), then sorry, no such luck. I'd love to see an open-content project to gloss the entire Bible in ASL, because that could be remixed into lectionaries, etc.</p>
<p>That's a good transition into...</p>
<p><strong>Resources for Scripture</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the <em>Signing The Scriptures</em> book I mentioned above, I've been enjoying the <a href="http://www.bible.is/deaf-bible">Deaf Bible</a> as an Android app (free, and also available for Apple and Kindle!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prayers</p>
<ul>
<li>The Deaf Apostolate of Boston has the <a href="http://www.deafcatholic.org/religious-education/asl-prayers">Our Father and Hail Mary on YouTube</a>, available with English subtitles.</li>
<li>Loyola Press has the <a href="http://www.loyolapress.com/american-sign-language-prayers.htm">Hail Mary, Our Father, and Act of Contrition on YouTube</a>, no subtitles. I appreciate seeing the different prayers modeled by different people, so you can figure out what's the underlying sign versus what is the individual quirk of the signer.</li>
</ul>
