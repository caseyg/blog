<p>I've seen the flashlight in my hand light up a white horse running in the foggy night, climbed behind the cobwebbed basketball hoop nailed to the barn loft, leaned my cheek against his back, embraced his breathing.</p>
<p>I've walked a canvas labyrinth all candle-lit among the silent tractors, warm breath misting in the shivering cold, hot tears freezing on my cheeks, sneakers crinkling in plastic bags.</p>
<p>I've held a tea ceremony inside an ICU room, hitchhiked up High Street to eat samosas out on a converted porch, spontaneously helped a retired state psychologist weed a garden.</p>
<p>These are the moments that make up my life; fragments, no center, no conclusion. Tucked between the surety of Milestones and Goals resides the real meat of beingness that makes me happy.</p>
