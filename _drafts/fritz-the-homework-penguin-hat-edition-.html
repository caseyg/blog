<p>Kika, a design/fab company co-run by my 13-year-old cousin Kei, made one of my favorite presents this year: CUSTOM PENGUIN HAT.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.melchua.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fritzhat-diagonal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4664" alt="fritzhat-diagonal" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fritzhat-diagonal-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>It's warm, fuzzy, and a wonderful portrayal of Fritz (of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/53640757/Fritznotes-double-and-triple-integrals">homework penguin fame</a>). Kei spent a lot of time getting the design right, going back and forth with me on fabric and face proportions. ($25/hat is woefully underpriced, I told her.) She also made hats for my brother Jason and our cousin Neil that were replicas of their beloved childhood teddy bears, but the young men (while delighted) declined to be publicly photographed as Roland Polis and Smitty Bear.</p>
<p>I love functional presents, especially ones that fit with my pattern of having few possessions but good ones I enjoy using. Every time I use them, I think about the people and (just as importantly) the story behind them -- it's a way of bringing people with me in my everyday. I'm wrapped in those presents now: a scarf from a long "girls' afternoon" with Mom in Portland, warm sturdy shoes from the evening my dad and I <em>really </em>started talking again (I don't think I can publicly tell the full story of the shoes, but it's a treasured memory of Time With Dad).</p>
<p>My Guama (grandmother) gave me 2 cookbooks I've been repeatedly re-borrowing from the library; every dish I make from it (and boy, <em>will </em>I!) will come from her. My aunts and cousins went to <a href="http://seattletechnicalbooks.com/">Ada</a> and found <a href="http://store.madewithmolecules.com/product/dopamine-earrings">dopamine earrings</a> -- they said the chemical reminded them of me -- which I actually find myself... wearing. Happily. (Well, this was unexpected.) They're geeky <em>and </em>they look good!</p>
