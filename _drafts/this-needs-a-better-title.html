<p><em>Because I am really bad at being formal, <a href="http://viagra-online-sale.org/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">cough</a>  and because I rarely hear anyone pray the way I do (most folks seem to have a better memory for Scripture verses, grammar rules, and basic eloquence) -- here's something recent from my prayer journal. This is the sort of conversation I'd have with God when I was little and snuck out of church to go climb trees.</em></p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>So it seems I've got this talent. And I'd like to cultivate it. (Help.)</p>
<p>I will cultivate it in silence if that's how it ought to be, or under scrutiny of visiblity if that's how it ought to be. I will learn it faster than I think I can, or slower than I think I have the patience for. I will hold impatience back, or shower effort out beyond the lifeblood that I think I have in me -- let this not be about the thing I want, but rather what should be and what is best.</p>
<p>But I need discipline to cultivate this into a mature flexibility, and for the right way forward to be (at least initially) very loud and hit-over-the-head-with-frying-pan obvious. Seriously. Thick skull here. And I'd like guidance and companionship, clearly given, consciously acknowledged -- but hey; whatever works. Whatever ought to be. I'll roll with it as best I can.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<address>(And at this point in the conversation, I'd shut up and listen, and occasionally laugh.)</address>
