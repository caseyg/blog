<p>Lobe Den Herren - Praise To The Lord</p>
<p>meeting Sr. Necitas; tschokolade - liturgy of the hours in the dom, <a href="http://buyviagraonline-canada.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">urologist</a>  dawn light filtering</p>
<p>and then again in our living room</p>
<p>and again, chanting, in mundelein</p>
<p>that the same god whose people chanted in Nyanja, wrapped in chitenge printed with bold blue mary</p>
<p>is the same god whose good-humored priests and people enfolded me in lectio in ohio snowstorms</p>
<p>and the same god whose aging priest ministered with great devotion to a heartbreakingly empty, tiny church in the middle of manhattan where little italy and chinatown meet -- a man tenderly honoring his bride</p>
<p>is the same god who stands, hard to hear, amidst the electric fans and powerpoints with psalm responses in the philippines -- and in the rolling meadows in tanay (the only place in the Philippines I've actually felt close to God)</p>
<p>the same god sitting quietly in missouri as i cried after confession in the midst of dancing, who sent two seminarians to pray with me the next day after eucharistic service</p>
<p>who's up already by the time i stagger (on occasion) to st. boniface at 6:30am on weekdays to receive him</p>
<p>the same god</p>
