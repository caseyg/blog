<p>Students do not <em>magically </em>know how to work in a studio environment. Asking good questions, knowing when to ask instructors for feedback, figuring out which instructor to ask about what topic, articulating <em>how </em>you need an instructor to help you on a particular topic -- these are all learned skills. My intent in these handouts is to start making them more explicit and to scaffold students into mature studio-learning behavior, very, <em>very </em>fast.</p>
<p>I'm experimenting with making hand-drawn handouts for my college-level teaching. Rich Dionne and Davin Huston have been super-gracious about letting me jump in and help coach teams through the PPI design lab's end-of-term push, and to get myself up to speed on the students -- and vice versa -- I decided to... draw things.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that these sheets may see more general usage in the future, so here's the two-page handout -- it's designed for undergraduate (STEM) studio courses I teach. The first page is a manual on "how to utilize the Mel," including accessibility considerations and a starting list of my skillsets. The second page is a group status check-in document. Feedback/edit-suggestions for future versions is quite welcome.</p>

Sometimes</p>
<p><strong>“Gestalt Prayer” by Fritz Perls, <br />
  1969</strong></p>
<p>I do my thing and you do your thing.<br />
I am not in this world to live up to your expectations, <br />
And you are not in this world to live up to mine.<br />
You are you and I am I;<br />
If by chance we find each other, it’s beautiful<br />
If not, it can’t be helped.</p>
<p><strong>"Beyond Perls" by Walter Tubbs, 1996</strong></p>
<p>If I just do my thing and you do yours,<br />
We stand in danger of losing each other<br />
And ourselves.</p>
<p>I am not in this world to live up to your expectations;<br />
But I am in this world to confirm you<br />
As a unique human being,<br />
And to be confirmed by you.</p>
<p>We are fully ourselves only in relation to each other;<br />
The I detached from a Thou<br />
Disintegrates.</p>
<p>I do not find you by chance;<br />
I find you by an active life<br />
Of reaching out.</p>
<p>Rather than passively letting things happen to me,<br />
I can act intentionally to make them happen.</p>
<p>I must begin with myself, true;<br />
But I must not end with myself:<br />
The truth begins with two.</p>
