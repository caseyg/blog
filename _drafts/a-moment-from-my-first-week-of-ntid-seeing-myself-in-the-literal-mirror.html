<p>Some of you already know (and my previous blog post has hinted) that I'm working in a Deaf environment for the first time in my life -- the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/ntid/cat/">Center on Access Technology</a> (CAT, pronounced like the animal and signed as an acronym) in Rochester, NY. There's far too much to say about this -- I am glad to be here, it's an incredible learning experience, and I often feel like a stranger in a strange land... but if there's anything my training in writing and qualitative research has taught me, it's the power of vignettes and thick descriptions of small moments. So that's what I'll start to share.</p>
<p>This one is a very small moment, but it was one of the first things that struck me.</p>
<p>So I'm a new faculty member, trying to figure out how one connects to internet, printers, and so forth, as one does. I'm hitting snags, so I walk over to the IT office inside NTID (basically, the Deaf college within RIT).</p>
<p>I nervously approach the front desk, clutching my laptop in one hand and signing with the other; this quickly turns into a two-handed exchange with the IT guy (I put the laptop down) and, after he understands the nature of my problem, he takes my laptop and starts fiddling with settings to see if he can figure out what I haven't been able to.</p>
<p>So far, so good. What I expected. I mean, it's the same as going to IT anywhere else, except we're just... signing. (Which is still weird to me, but... okay.)</p>
<p>But then I look around the room while he's typing away, and I start noticing. It's an IT office. There are bins and boxes and shelves with hardware marked with post-its. There are cables, there are multiple monitor setups, standing desks, ergonomic keyboards, quick-reference cheat-sheets on the wall. All the things you'd usually see in a room full of people who work professionally with computers. I'm also a computer nerd, I worked IT in undergrad... it feels like home. I see the student workers perched in front of monitors, like I used to, checking tickets on some system that I can't identify, but which looks like every other IT ticketing system I've ever seen; information-dense, pragmatically laid out,</p>
<p>And then I notice that all of the desks facing the wall have mirrors on that wall, behind the monitors.</p>
