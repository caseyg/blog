<p>my sense is that you either hit a wall or got sidetracked<br />
Can you give me an update on where you are at?  If we are going to reschedule - we need to figure out what is possible asap.</p>
<p>Some thoughts:<br />
- This may be the first time you really hit a wall…we all hit this wall (multiple times).  It's normal - the trick is accepting that you hit the wall and asking for help so you can move past it.</p>
<p>Yes, I've hit a wall -- and it's the first time I've truly hit a writing wall. Which is good, actually; these are the labor pains of my scholarly voice being born. (Julia &amp; Dr. Radcliffe reminded me of this on Monday.) I've gotten by for years with writing talent compensating for sloppy discipline, and this is kind of the first time I'm being forced to be a real writer, rather than someone who does it only when it's easy/fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the scholarly voice isn't just writing in a particular way…but saying particular kinds of things - it's not just about telling us a solution but making an argument for why that problem is important and why that solution will respond to that problem.  Hence….making an argument.  Think of it like design - yeah, we can come up with solutions but how does it help solve a problem?  The harder part of design is the framing - it's also the most creative part because this is where you make choices…the solution you come up with is just a result of those choices.</p>
<p>The purpose of this narrative study is to analyze how engineering and technology faculty articulate their teaching identities when they engage in public storytelling about their experiences serving on curriculum revision teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labor pains.</p>
