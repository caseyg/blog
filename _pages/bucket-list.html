<p><strong>Travel around the world for a year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wilderness survival.</strong> I'd like to be able to walk out somewhere with a blanket and a knife (and possibly a few other things) for a few weeks and be able to build a shelter and a fire, <a href="http://viagranoprescription.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">viagra order</a>  find and prepare food, <a href="http://buy-canadian-cialis.com/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">injection</a>  perform basic first aid, <a href="http://pharmacy-viagra.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>  identify, appreciate, and utilize my surroundings, and not feel too self-conscious taking a shit in the woods. Something like <a href="http://rootsvt.com/wsip">ROOTS school</a> would be my dream way of learning this - I do very well with immersion - but I am also waiting for post-graduate-school when I settle down somewhere a bit more so that I can learn survival skills specific to my region.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking.</strong> This means a few things, primarily. First, basic skills. Second, regional cuisines - for me, Italian and Indian. Third, cooking for other people - do either a I'll-cook-for-you tour of other people's kitchens, or host an underground restaurant at least half a dozen times.</p>

<p>Classical piano: Record a Beethoven sonata (probably the "Pathetique" or "Moonlight" - but every single movement!), Lizst's "Liebestraum," a Bach-Busoni piece, and a cleverly refingered adaptation of something Rachmaninoff wrote.</p>
<p>Jazz and blues music: Play at a jam in a strange city, and play live music for a dance I'm also dancing at.</p>
<p>Parkour: Run both Cambridges.</p>
<p>Martial arts: Compete in a tournament fight.</p>
<p>Tai chi: Do the long form every morning for 100 consecutive days.</p>
<p>Bodywork: Become certified in some form of deep-tissue bodywork. Rolfing and Thai massage are the top contenders right now.</p>
<p>Percussion: Participate in either a taiko or drumline performance.</p>
<p>Film: Work on effects for a sci-fi or fantasy film.</p>
<p>Dance: Teach a beginner blues class.</p>
<p>Woodwork: Make my own desk.</p>
<p>Embedded engineering: Make my own alarm clock.</p>
<p>Clothing: Make my own earrings, necklace, and bracelet for a special occasion. Recut all my open source t-shirts so they actually fit.</p>
