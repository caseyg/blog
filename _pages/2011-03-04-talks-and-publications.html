<p>(March 2014 note: This is woefully out of date now after 3 years of graduate school and nonstop writing/teaching/publishing. If you'd like an updated copy, <a href="http://cialis-sale-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">cialis 40mg</a>  <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/contact">contact</a> me and it'll nudge me to update my CV and send it to you, <a href="http://viagra-online-sale.org/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">cialis sale</a>  and enough nudges of that sort should prompt me to update this page. Go go gadget policy of painful honesty.)</p>
